To run the program:
Go to www.marmot.com and add at least 2 products to your cart, then return to the homepage. Paste the code directly into the browser console and scroll to the bottom of the page.

My approach:
I used the Waypoints library to trigger a function when the user scrolls to a certain area on the page. Data from the cart is first stored in a JS object then displayed in a dialog box, set on top of an overlay.
